# Crypto-Crazy-SwiftUI
This is an app which the users can find different crypto curriencies as a list. To see more crypto currencies, the users can just scroll down. In order to build this app, I benefited from SwiftUI and MVVM design pattern. In Model file, I created model by using struct which has Hashable, Decodable, and Identifiable protocols. Also, inside struct, there is a private enum CodingKeys to work id, currency, price properly one another. In View Model, I created a class which has ObservableObject protocol. In addition, I used @Published typealias in order to connect with View and View Model. Also, I downloaded crypto currency data in this file. As for Main View, I benefited from @ObservedObject @frozen struct to establish a bond between View and View Model. I demonstrated the data came from Json file in the form of a list. Finally, in Webservice file, I imported the data with a function which has completion and @escaping. @escaping gives us the things it returns inside completion block and Result. Inside this function, I downloaded the data and checked whether there is an error, data or not. I decoded the data as well in this function.
